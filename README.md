# Real-time-Child-tracking-system
A real time based system built on  open source software and hardwares that do enhance parents/guardians to locate their kids over the world wide web via an implanted prototype device on their children.

Instructions on how to load the files into your server or system.
-  The arduino code should go into your arduino documents folder on your system.
- Load the gpstracker folder into your htdocs directory of your web server.

**The hardware devices needed for the project.**
- Arduino Uno.
- Arduino Wireless Wifi Shield.
- Connecting wires/Jumper cables.
- Gps Module & antenna in handy.

**The preferred softwares include:**
- Arduino IDE - for running the arduino codes and uploading them to the Arduino Uno
- Sublime-Text - For manipulating the web side php and css codes.
- Fritzing - For schematic drawings and sketching of the connections in your project documentation.
