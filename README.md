# Real-time-Child-tracking-system
A real-time system, constructed using open-source software and hardware, empowers parents or guardians to track their children globally through an embedded prototype device.

To set it up, follow these instructions to load the necessary files onto your server or system:

Copy the Arduino code to your Arduino documents folder on your system.
Place the "gpstracker" folder into the htdocs directory of your web server.

The necessary hardware components for the project are as follows:

- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Wireless Wifi Shield
- Connecting wires or jumper cables
- GPS module and its accompanying antenna
  
As for software, the recommended options are:

- Arduino IDE: Used for executing and uploading the Arduino codes to the Arduino Uno board.
- Sublime Text / Visual Studio Code: Ideal for editing and managing the PHP and CSS codes on the web side.
- Fritzing: Useful for creating schematic drawings and sketches to document the connections in your project.
